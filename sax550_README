Hello, thank you for looking at my project modification, Finch_enhancement. 
The only file that has been changed from the original version so far is the finch.py file. All other files so far
remain exactly the same as if you downloaded it from bird brain studios yourself. 
if you would like to download the original module it is available at https://www.birdbraintechnologies.com/. 
The finch robot is required for this project. Thanks - Cameron
